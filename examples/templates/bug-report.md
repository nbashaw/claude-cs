Hi [Customer Name],

Thanks for reporting this! I'm sorry you're experiencing issues with [FEATURE].

I've logged this as a bug with our engineering team. Here's what I know so far:

**What we're investigating:**
[Brief description of the issue in your own words]

**Next steps:**
[What will happen next - investigation, fix timeline if known, workaround if available]

I'll keep you updated as we make progress on this. If you have any additional details that might help (screenshots, specific steps you took, etc.), please feel free to share them.

Thanks for your patience!

Best,
[Your Name]
