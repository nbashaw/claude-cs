Use this template when approving a refund request.

## Template

Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out. I've processed your refund of [AMOUNT] to your original payment method.

You should see the refund reflected in your account within 5-10 business days, depending on your bank's processing time.

Your subscription has been [canceled/will remain active until [DATE]].

If you have any other questions or would like to come back in the future, we'd be happy to have you!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Variables to Replace
- `[Customer Name]` - Use customer's first name or "there"
- `[AMOUNT]` - Full refund amount with currency (e.g., "$29.99")
- `[canceled/will remain active until [DATE]]` - Choose based on subscription status
- `[Your Name]` - Your name or leave blank for email signature

## Notes
- Be warm and understanding - they're already frustrated
- Be specific about timing (5-10 days is realistic for most banks)
- Clarify subscription status to avoid follow-up questions
- Leave door open for returning (many do!)

## When to use
- Customer explicitly requested refund
- Refund was approved per company policy
- Refund has been processed (don't send before processing!)
